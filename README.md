# OpenAI API Course Asimov Academy  
This repository contains the challenges proposed by teacher Adriano Soares during the Exploring OpenAI's API course at Asimov Academy.

## Challenge 1: Chatbot  
Implementation of a Python chatbot using OpenAI's GPT API (`gpt-3.5-turbo`) to generate real-time responses. I implemented a simple CLI chatbot that can take promps and generate text.

## Challenge 2: Finance Chatbot
Implementation of a Python chatbot using OpenAI's GPT API (`gpt-3.5-turbo`), Yahoo Finance's API and function calling to generate real-time responses. I implemented a CLI chatbot that can take prompts and use function calling to generate text about finances if needed.
